# What is this?
I started learning about WordPress and PHP by starting a project for a restaurant website. There is a chinese restaurant that I go occassionally for cheap food and I notice that they do not have a main homepage for their restaurant. I wanted to create a website for them and display their menus and contact information and images of their food.



# My Thoughts/What I learned:
I learned how to work with plugins, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Using the free [bento theme](https://satoristudio.net/bento-free-wordpress-theme/),
I learned how to tweak free WordPress themes after many trial and error with getting the CSS to work the way I wanted.

Inspired by some web design techniques on other restaurant websites, I was able to implement my own version of what I wanted for a chinese restaurant website.
